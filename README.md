# But ’em buttons

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Duplicate the design & interactivity of the banner with `:hover` & `:active` states—and `transition`.
- `transform` isn’t used anywhere in `main.css` to complete the functionality—mostly just `position`.
- The bottom, 3D, part of the button is another element inside the `.btn` `<a>` tag that’s positioned. It has a height that is manipulated.
- Export & save the two graphics properly from Photoshop & Illustrator.
- Text can be found inside the `content.txt` file.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
